## Getting Started
Before you start contributing, make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed. Refer to the project's README for detailed instructions on setting up the development environment.

### ðŸ™‹ I have a Question!

If you have a question about the project or need help with something, please read the documentation in [README.md](../README.md) or [docs](chapter0.md) first. If you can't find an answer, try to search for similar issues or discussions in the project's GitHub repository.

You can try tweeting at the project's maintainers while referencing the project's GitHub repository. If you don't get a response, consider submitting an issue on the repository, following the guidelines below.

## Submitting an Issue
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please submit an issue on the project's GitHub repository. Provide a clear and concise description of the problem or request, along with any relevant details or steps to reproduce the issue.

Before submitting an issue, check the existing issues to see if a similar one has already been reported. If you find a related issue, you can add a comment to provide more information or upvote the issue to show that it is affecting more users.

If you are submitting a bug report, include the following information:
- Detailed description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Expected behavior.
- Actual behavior.
- Screenshots or error messages (if applicable).
- Environment details (e.g., operating system, browser, version).
- Any additional information that may be relevant.
- If possible, provide a fix or workaround for the issue.
  
If you are submitting a feature request, include the following information:
- Detailed description of the feature.
- Use cases or examples of how the feature would be used.
- Any relevant information that may help implement the feature.
- If possible, provide a code snippet or example implementation of the feature.
- Indicate if you are willing to work on implementing the feature.

After submitting an issue, you can track its progress and participate in discussions with the project maintainers and other contributors. Be responsive to any follow-up questions or requests for more information to help resolve the issue quickly.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Learn how to create a pull request [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

OR

Follow the steps below:
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Make your changes and ensure they adhere to the project's coding standards.
3. Write clear and concise commit messages.
4. Push your branch to your forked repository.
5. Open a pull request on the main repository, describing the changes you made and why they are necessary.

## Code Style
Maintaining a consistent code style is important for readability and maintainability. Please follow the project's established code style guidelines. If there are no specific guidelines, try to match the existing codebase.

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a good practice for writing commit messages. They provide a consistent structure that makes it easier to understand the changes made in a commit.

## Documentation
Good documentation is crucial for understanding and maintaining the project. If you make changes that affect the project's documentation, please update it accordingly. This includes code comments, README files, and any other relevant documentation like [docs](chapter0.md).

Everything could be improved, *even this document*. If you see a typo, an error, or something that could be explained better, feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request to fix it.

## Testing
Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes pass all relevant tests. If the project has a test suite, run it locally to verify the correctness of your changes. If there are no tests, consider adding them to cover your changes. 

## Contact
If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers via the contact information provided in the repository's README.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you!
